Project Gutenberg Files

-Book 1 - Frankenstein         - https://www.gutenberg.org/files/84/84-h/84-h.htm
-Book 2 - Pride and Prejudice  - https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1342/1342-h/1342-h.htm
-Book 3 - A Tale of Two Cities - https://www.gutenberg.org/files/98/98-h/98-h.htm

Changes Made to HTML Files

- The CSS from each file was completely removed, and replaced with a custom style. (ie all CSS found on each html file was made by Graeme)

- The directory that stored the images was renamed 'images', and hence the HTML was updated to reflect this change.


Custom Style Explanation

- Background of body was changed to a yellowish color
- Headers centered, given a fancy font
- Paragraphs centered, and the text was justified
- Paragraphs were given a less fancy font
- The first letter of every paragraph is twice as large and has the extra fancy font
- Images were centered, and given a 'ridge' border
- Links were centered, colored grey instead of blue, and made to turn red when the mouse hovers over them
